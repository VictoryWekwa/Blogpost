## Github - The Developer's Handbag ðŸ‘œ

During my start.ng internship, I had a task on using Git and this introduced me to Git and Gitflow because during the course of the internship all task were submitted on Github.

For me I will call GitHub the developer's handbag because it helps developers to store and manage their project while still working on it and updating changes.


In this article, I  will be writing about Github and it's principles, so sit back and enjoy.

## So Let's Get started

Firstly, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that basically helps developers save, store and manage their code, including keeping track and controlling changes made to code. 

### Github Principles

To understand GitHub you have to understand two important principles which are **Git** and **Version Control**.

### Version Control

Version Control helps developers track and manage changes made on a project. It gives developers the opportunity to safely work through branching and merging.

With branching, a developer can duplicate part of the source code (called the repository). And then make changes without affecting all the other projects.

Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the work, the developer can now merge the work to show that he or she is done. All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if there is any need for it.



Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developerâ€™s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.

According to a  [Stackoverflow](https://Stackoverflow.org)  developer survey, over 87% of developers use Git.

GitHub is also a not-for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration especially when it comes to working on big team projects.

## Conclusion

GitHubâ€™s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.
